# Welcome to CEAZA-M3!
Solar charger for 12V SLA battery in CEAZA MEGA system.

# What is the CEAZA-M3?
Is a solar PWM charger for 12V SLA battery board compatible with CEAZA MEGA system, which allow recharge the system battery every day and avoid system failure due lack of energy storage.
The CEAZA M3 have below specs:
- Only for 12V SLA batteries.
- 18Vmpp Solar pannel (absolute maximum 28V)
- Solar pannel voltage monitor.
- Battery voltage monitor.
- Status LED red and green powered from solar panel which indicates charging or done respectively.
- Ready to solder pins for easy prototyping.

This board is pin compatible and should be connected to the CEAZA MEGA system to proper work.

## Documentation
A comprehensive documentation for well undertand, use or modify the CEAZA M3 board is available in our Wiki. In adition, we share with you the schematics diagrams, adns Arduino example codes.

## Quickstart guide
Install the M3 board in the CEAZA MEGA's bottom, make certain connection throuhg the boards by three 2 x 10 pin header terminals is rigth. Plug the battery and solar panel cables in the respective board terminal. be careful to avoid swap both plugs, due they are the same type of terminals. Connect the CEAZA MEGA main board system to the host PC by mini-USB connector, open the Arduino ide software, select the Arduino Mega board and the correspondign COM port.
Open any of examples scketches and upload to the board.
### WARNING!
Do not connect the battery in the main CEAZA MEGA power plug when you connect the M3 board. This may cause an electric problem in the system.
